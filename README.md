Features:
Dynamic Image Loading: Images are dynamically added to the gallery using JavaScript, making it easy to add or update images.
Lightbox View: A lightbox effect allows users to view a single image in a larger size within the same window.
Image Hover Effect: Images slightly zoom in when the mouse hovers over them, providing visual feedback.
Responsive Design: The gallery and lightbox should adapt to different screen sizes.
